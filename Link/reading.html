    <p>"Reading" is the process of looking at a series of written symbols and getting meaning from them.
         When we read, we use our eyes to receive written symbols (letters, punctuation marks and spaces) and we use our brain to convert them into words, sentences and paragraphs that communicate something to us.</p>

    <p>You can call a book lover a bibliophile. If you find it impossible to leave a book store without buying at least one book, you might be a bibliophile.
       A bibliophile usually has a huge collection of books and loves nothing more than browsing in a used book shop or a library.</p>
