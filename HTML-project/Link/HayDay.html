     <p>Hay Day is a festive farming simulator that <strong>allows players to try their hands at agriculture, planting crops and caring for livestock in order to earn gold</strong>. 
        The more they harvest from their fields and collect from their animals, like dairy cows and chickens, the more points they earn toward gaining levels.</p>
     <img src="../Images/day.jpg" alt="GameImage">
     <p>Welcome animals like chickens, pigs, and cows to your farm as you expand and grow! Feed your animals to produce eggs, bacon, dairy, and more to trade with neighbors or fill delivery truck orders for coins.
         Build a farm and expand it to its fullest potential, from a small-town farm to a full-blown business.</p>
